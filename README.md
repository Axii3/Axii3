## Axii3

I love videogames and I love coding

I am working with godot for the most time but I love sidequests because you can learn so much!

I also published some projects on my itch.io page:
https://axii3.itch.io/

Unity was my main game engine but I decided to switch to Godot so thats what I use now.
I also worked with the Monogame framework, Unreal Engine, Javascript and Python.

For 3D models I use blender

For texturing, icons and design I use Affinity
