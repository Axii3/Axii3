## Axii3

I love Videogames and I love coding

I am working with godot for the most time but I love Sidequests because you can learn so much!

I also published some projects on my itch.io page:

Unity was my main Game Engine but I decided to switch to Godot so thats what I use now.
I also worked with the Monogame framework, Unreal Engine, HTML and Javascript and Python but not crazy much.
